# mander-tracker
Welcome to Post Combat! This is a web application I built to help track the stats among me and my friends of our weekly (sometimes semi-weekly) games of Magic The Gathering. 

It is built entirely in React on the front, interacting with a super quick database/API in Supabase.

Something I was proud of to acheive in Post Combat is the ability to track stats uniquely among different groups you are a part of. So one could have different stats using the same Magic deck in one group of friends than they do in another. 

If you happened to get through these explanations of my webapp, enjoy poking around the robust codebase I have procured in the past few months :-)
